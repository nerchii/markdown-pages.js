# Uvod u markdown
## Create sophisticated formatting for your prose and code on GitHub with simple syntax.
### Headings
To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the hierarchy level and typeface size of the heading.

```
# A first-level heading
## A second-level heading
### A third-level heading
```

When you use two or more headings, GitHub automatically generates a table of contents that you can access by clicking  within the file header. Each heading title is listed in the table of contents and you can click a title to navigate to the selected section.

### Quoting text
You can quote text with a >.
```
Text that is not a quote

> Text that is a quote
Quoted text is indented, with a different type color.
```

### Quoting code
You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted. You can also press the Command+E (Mac) or Ctrl+E (Windows/Linux) keyboard shortcut to insert the backticks for a code block within a line of Markdown.
```
Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.
